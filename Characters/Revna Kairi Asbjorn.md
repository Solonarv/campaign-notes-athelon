solonarv - human bladesinger wizard

**Age** 23, **Height** 171 cm, **Weight** 70 kg  
**Skin** pale, **Eyes** green, **Hair** brown (natural) / black (dyed)

- born Tomas Ulfric Asbjorn, third son of Count Ulfric Halvard Asbjorn of blah and his wife Ingrid Kairi
	- two older brothers, one older sister -> well out of the line of succession
- in a typical move for third sons, sent off to study at the academy of maxxpls at age 15
	- this is a typical move because later children are often expected to take advisory roles to their inheriting elder siblings
- figured out she's a girl while there, transitioned to become Raevna Kairi Asbjorn, and graduated at age 20
	- she did have support from her family for this, they're not estranged
	- was an avid duelist there (she likes stabbing people)
	- absorbed a lot of pro-guild and anti-feudal attitudes there
- spent the next three years wandering the world (mostly Thelsya), broadening her horizons
- between the academy and the wandering years she pretty much has a whole new personality
	- this is good, the old one was cringe (we won't go into it)
- returned home recently for the first time in eight years, surprised by how bad things have gotten
	- big fight with mom & dad & heir the day of her return, clash of politics (very obvious)
	- this gets her kicked out of the house, and cut off
- she hears of CAMPAIGN_START_QUEST_GUY's problems and responds to his call for help because they were childhood friends (they drifted apart since, but still exchanged letters occasionally)



Youngest of four children (two sons, one daughter), born a third son, Raevna never had any prospects of inheriting her father Johan's lands and title. With the guilds ascendant, the family could not support a layabout son (or daughter, as it would turn out), so she studied the blade from an early age, in addition to the arcane tomes she devoured. No sooner did she turn eighteen than she set out to make her own way in the world.

Only rarely visiting home between occasionally life-threatening, but mostly tedious and long-winded, voyages, she could do no more than observe the slow ascendancy of the guilds and impoverishing of her family. 

On one such visit home, she was greeted by a face she hadn't seen in a decade: NAME_OF_THE_GUY, who she remembered sparring against in her childhood, at least until their skills with and without magery grew too mismatched. It appeared he had inherited his mother's lands while she was gone, and with them, an endless list of problems; one which she was now expected to attack, in lieu of her own family's evaporated wealth.

thoughts:
Revna's family are mid-level nobles - big enough to have vassal lords, one of which is the guy we're helping (a baron, let's say). The family can't really buy out the baron's debt (too expensive, and the optics are bad), can't kick off the guilds by open force (optics, fear of retaliation), and does not have many assets to leverage - except Revna.
