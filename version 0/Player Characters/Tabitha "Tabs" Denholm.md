### Backstory
Daughter of a couple of innkeepers in Rivell, a city on the edge of the desert between the Dominion and elderwel.

Tabitha grew up in the inn, helping out here and there but mostly getting underfoot and asking too many questions. To get her out of the way, her parents often sent her away on errands, and she proved to be a fast runner, quickly learning which alleys were shortcuts and which were best avoided. Tabitha didn't mind, as she was a free spirit by nature and somewhat resented being stuck around the inn.

Eventually, patrons noticed, and Tabitha began bringing in a bit of extra cash by running messages and small parcels as well. She managed to barter her quick legs into not just money, but also answers to her many questions about how the universe worked.

At age fifteen she ran a parcel to a local wizard that she was assured was perfectly mundane and uninteresting; however, she was pursued by thieves, who forced her to take a particularly dangerous route. Unsurprisingly, she twisted her ankle, but having guessed that the contents were in fact quite special, she took a gamble: she would risk delivering the parcel anyway, and hope to extract concessions from the wizard by playing on his guilt. The gamble paid off; he paid for her healing, and as she assured him that she was not upset at him, he continued to hire her more and more frequently.

Through her work, Tabitha struck up a friendship of sorts with the wizard, and after two years of this she got a place as his apprentice. Finally she would learn how to do actual magic!

She proved quite talented, and incorporated magic into her courier work (which she was still pursuing, as a means of paying for her apprenticeship and as a calling in itself); after just four years, the wizard declared her apprenticeship finished, and Tabitha ready to practice and learn wizardry on her own in the wider world.

She spent another few months working in Rivell, but the announcement of Queen Leandra's marriage was, to Tabitha, an opportunity to move up in the world. Visiting Visallia at a time where it would be abuzz with activity seemed like an excellent way to make more contacts, find more opportunities to learn, and finally spread her wings.

#### On the Application of Arcane Magics to Unpredictable Workloads
This is Tabitha's arcane thesis (Spell Substitution), which is split into two parts - motivation and method.

##### Motivation
She puts a heavy emphasis on flexibility and the importance of not being locked into the choices made at the start of the day, and draws examples from her varied work as a courier. Couriers often do not know what they will be carrying where until it is pressed into their hands, but different situations call for vastly different magical assistance: the courier might have to defend herself, nonviolently throw off pursuit, carry heavy loads, or pass unnoticed. The ability to foresee which of those might be the case for a specific parcel, and to switch her magical loadout to accomodate the task, has been very valuable to Tabitha, her mentor, and her clients. She declares that this could apply to many other professions too.

##### Method
This section describes in detail the mental and magical conditioning Tabitha put herself through in order to switch her magical loadout nearly on the fly. It is full of technical detail, and notes many small hurdles and pain points she found in the process.
