Session 1 scrapped, start is now:

> "Before the rule of the Jozvanian empire, the region of Elderwel, which hugs the southern coast of the inner sea, was controlled by 6 noble houses. These houses warred with each other over who was the rightful ruler of the land. After being annexed by the empire, the rulership of Elderwel was given to House Noveran, who continued to rule the land as High Kings and Queens after the empire fell. The current High Queen, Leandra Noveran, is soon to marry and dignitaries from all across the kingdom are travelling to the city of Visallia, seat of House Noveran. People from all walks of life are following them as well, seeking the opportunities such gatherings create. Your character is one of these people."
> all of you, on your way to Visallia, arrive at the same town on the same day and were planning to stay the night at the inn. but the owner is not letting anyone inside after her daughter went missing and your characters agreed to find her

[[Tabitha "Tabs" Denholm]] and [[Aldon Khoren]] previously met in [[Rivell]] on the way: Aldon stayed at the inn Tabitha's family runs, where she overheard him mention that he was traveling to [[Visallia]]. They went "same hat!" at each other and decided to travel there together, with Aldon trying to take on the role of a protective older brother and Tabitha insisting she can take care of herself.

It's the last month of summer, 25th of Bloom's End.
gray and slightly overcast, slight breeze, but a warm one

been on the road for a while, heading to Visallia to witness the wedding of Queen Leandra.
just a few days away from the city, decide to stop in the little town of Asher's Mill
milling village
around mid-day
inn's closed!
owner (Hilda, human woman, 40s, plump and hearty, fiery red hair, simple clothes, apron, sad face) has closed it after her daughter has gone missing.
we all agreed to help find her daughter. in exchange we get accomodations.

Aldon: how old is she? 15. young girl.
Tarot: an area where she might have gone? an area kids are told to avoid? nah, this place is calm and boring
local guards numbers depleted with the guards 
girl is responsible, doesn't wander off into the forest or anything
forest just has normal forest dangers
daughter's name: Lydia
Hilda blames Lydia's boyfriend
we ask: who is this boyfriend?
younger son of the owner of the mill, 17 y/o half-elf. always trouble, many pranks. Lydia is infatuated with that knife-ear, and Hilda just knows he's got something to do with this.
Tarot: any contact with the boyfriend's parents? yes, the owners of the mill. everyone knows them. she can take us there.
daughter gone for 2 days
Tabs: where & when was Lydia last seen? closing down the kitchen for the night, done with dinner. She was going to go to her room, to sleep. Then in the morning, her window was open, her bedsheets hanging from it.
Aldon: has the boyfriend also been missing? She hasn't been paying attention to him, more worried about her own daughter.

description of Lydia: same red hair, but more beautiful. She keeps it very clean and nice. Tall, taller than Hilda (because of her father). Carries a pendant with her, from her father, one of the last things left from before he died: a crescent moon.

OOC, we describe our characters:
 - [[Aldon Khoren]]
 - [[Anthil Woolithus]]
 - [[Tabitha "Tabs" Denholm]]
 - [[Wyrdhunter Tarot]]

We ask Hilda to introduce us to the owner of the mill. She takes us across the village, up to the river, where there is a water mill. Bunch of people working: carrying chunks of wood, handling big logs, and so on.
She takes us to a middle-aged man, blond, beard. Thick built human, simple clothes, white linen shirt, loose trousers, looking at some ledgers: the owner of the mill, Bradston. She introduces us.
Aldon: where's your youngest son? Cole, locked in his room for the past two days. Man says the boy therefore can't have done anything to us.
Doesn't know what's gotten into the boy. They talk at him through the door and bring food, but he just mumbles back.
Tabitha points out that this is also how long Lydia has been missing.
He slept through the boy's return, but his wife is a light sleeper and said she heard him come home.

Aldon asks Bradston if he'll let us (try) to speak with the boy. He will not, but he'll go ask the boy if he knows anything. He calls one of his workers to take over for him for now.
He suggests we come along, it'll be quicker that way. Hilda splits off again. He takes us to one of the largest houses in the village (though not fancy). A half-elf woman, light brown hair, green eyes, cleaning the porch with a broom: his wife. He tells her about the situation and goes in.

We speculate: what might have happened? Teenage tryst, perhaps they saw something in the woods that they shouldn't, perhaps something else bad happened.
Aldon asks about Tarot's scribblings: notes on the situation, and wild conjectures.

We now properly introduce ourselves to each other.

Aldon Khoren: distinctive western accent, from the Dominion. Traveling with Tabitha.

Tabitha: "Tabitha Denholm, wizarding courier" and a funky salute. My friends call me Tabs. I'm traveling to Visallia too, looking for... opportunity, I suppose.

Tarot: Honored that we trust him and each other with names, he keeps his closer to his chest. Names have power, after all. We can call him Tarot. Tabitha nods along at this.

Anthil: Anthil.

Aldon and Anthil and Tarot wander around the house, searching for clues.
Tarot finds a window from which spills the voice of the father. He's asking his son about stuff, mentions Lydia at one point. Another voice (young male) in the room starts crying. He comes to find us and tells us about this.

Bradston comes back, looking like he wasn't successful. "My son doesn't want to talk to me. But... he started crying, so I think something happened. Which is more than he was telling us before."

Anthil asks, awkwardly: where do teenagers go to be teenagers, around here? Bradston dispels the awkwardness. Says his son went to meet with Lydia at this grove where a spring crosses. He thinks he knows where it is. Grabs some parchment, draws a crude map.

We leave Bradston there. Tarot checks on the window again, and the rest of us come with.

Tarot climbs onto the windowsill. From there, he sees a messy room, a half-elven teenager with dark blond hair beneath the sheets, sobbing gently.
He comes back down and asks us if he should say something to the kid. Yes, but what?
At Aldon's suggestion, Tarot mirrors up there again and apprehends Cole.
He's a skinny young half-elf, with a terrible attempt at a beard (just a few wisps of hair on his chin). Seeing Tarot, he gives a weird quiet scream and throws something at him.
Tarot repeats "do not be alarmed" and tries to assure Cole he means no harm. This doesn't go so well.
Tarot offers to help with his problems, which seems to get Cole's guard down. He's breaking down as he not-describes what happened. Something pursued him and Lydia, and he doesn't know if she's alive.
A weird thing appeared out of the woods, they ran, and he lost track of her. They were at this pretty grove, which Lydia likes because she can see the stars, doing stuff, and they heard a weird noise. Lydia thought it was just some small animal, and wanted to investigate. Then it growled. It scratched her, she screamed, it tried to get her, they ran. Then he turned back to see how she was doing, and she was gone.
He confirms this was at nighttime, a bit after dusk.
Tarot pledges to find closure, if not Lydia. He asks, in return, that Cole either answer the door or leave the window open so he can find his own way in.
Tarot's notebook has "werewolves" violently circled.

Tabs and Aldon don't remember much about werewolves, but you do need some kind of special weapon. Tarot knows that werewolves are weak to silver, and informs us of this. Do we have any silver weapons?

Tabs keeps a pair of pockets empty just for this purpose. She turns them inside out and says "do I look like I'm made of money?"

We decide to go to the grove and investigate in the daylight, trying to find tracks. We follow Anthil, and eventually he is confident he can get us there.
The floor of the forest is covered in pine needles and very thick roots, little ground cover, thick canopy.
As we travel, Anthil and Tarot notice some strange leaves and dirt on the ground: a sinkhole covered by loose leaves. Anthil removes the cover and sees that it's a 10ft drop; we would've fallen if they hadn't noticed.
6 #xp/award for defeating this deadly hazard!

We continue and eventually hear some howling noises. Anthil informs us they're not werewolves. We find the wolves eating a deer carcass. They attack us.

we take 10 minutes to patch up. Aldon lays on hands and refocuses; Tabitha substitutes a cantrip and casts mage armor.

We continute onward and arrive at the grove. It's very quiet, lit by the afternoon sun, bathed in golden light. There are flowers and butterflies around, it's a very pretty place.
Tabitha's *detect magic* pings nothing.
Anthil, Tarot, and Aldon look around. Anthil finds small splatters of blood in some bushes, and human footprints, and clawed footprints of a halfling-sized biped.
He leads us along the trail. The trail splits into two pairs of footprints, presumably Cole and Lydia, and then one ends in more blood splatters. There are drag marks, and another pair of humanlike footprints there.
Anthil leads us along the trail with the drag marks.

The forest opens onto a river, and there are some people - who look like bandits - around, resting. A dog alerts on us - well, on Aldon.
Aldon greets the probably-bandit (and dog) on guard. The guard demands to know who Aldon is. He introduces himself and says he's looking for a young girl. The guard says "no, now fuck off". Aldon turns to leave, but the guard tells him to stop and demands to take his stuff.
Aldon refuses, and the bandit reveals his banditness.

 - Aldon raises his shield, disarms the bandit, and glares at him.
 - Anthil runs in, designates the bandit as his prey, and stabs him with his forks.
 - The bandit runs away, pulls out a sling, and fires it at Aldon.
 - Tarot runs in, and caves the bandit's skull in.
 - Tabitha lays an illusion of warped terrain over the are where more bandits wait, slowing down reinforcements.
 - The first reinforcement laboriously makes his way across the warped terrain and misses Anthil with his sling.
 - The first, dead bandit's dog critically nibbles on Tarot
 - The second backup bandit picks his way across the warped terrain, plinks Tarot with his sling, and reloads.
 - The backup dog crosses the fallen log toward our side of the river
 - Aldon does some stuff
 - Anthil stabs the dead bandit's dog dead.
 - Tarot and starts mining the second dog.
 - Tabitha fires a flurry of magic missiles, finishing off that dog and injuring the next bandit.
 - That bandit closes with Tarot and knocks him down.
 - The last bandit plinks at Aldon with his sling.
 - Aldon applies lays hands on Tarot, healing him with the power of water. Then he raises his shield and put himself bodily in the bandits' way.
 - Anthil walks in and starts stabbing the front bandit.
 - Tarot stands up, chooses a personal anathema for the front bandit, and pulls 
 - Tabitha comes down the slope and agitates the rocks under the two bandits.

 - The back bandit frightens Tabitha, then whips a sling bullet right into her forehead.
 - Aldon disarms and scares the front bandit, then raises his shield.
 - Anthil stabs the front bandit some and runs back.
 - Tarot uses a scroll of *heal* and scares the back bandit.
 - Tabitha casts magic missile *again*, killing the front bandit with a force dart through the forehead.
 - The last bandit runs away.

Aldon channels healing energy into all of us through the water.
Tarot looks through the camp. He finds 3 gp 25 sp, a vial of (probably) poison, a silvery-looking paste - silversheen, apply to a weapon to make it count a silver for a while -, and a smokestick.
healing and resting takes us about 40 minutes.
