For the past week we've been traveling together. This is where we describe our characters to each other.

It's the morning, and we settle in for another day sailing.
At the front of the ship we see the captain talking with Gaspar and a half elf, Nilvar Alorus, the first mate. One of the other crewmates, a human teenage boy (Flynn), asks what we think these islands will be like?
We express general hope that they won't be as cold, with some gentle ribbing over our natures and outfit choices.
a lithe tengu woman (Yuu) that was working on the rigging up above contributes: the islands are quite warm, thanks to volcanic activity.

the cook, Fargus Belmar, interrupts us, carrying a pot of stew. says the islands are haunted, according to his grandmother. He sets down the pot and beckons us closer. Says it isn't ready yet, this is just storytime.
His grandma used to tell stories about the seas here, a ship that roams these seas full of the souls of the damned. It appears in the middle of the night, bringing doom to those who see them and add them to its undead crew.. Varrick is skeptical, but Tabitha states such phenomena do happen. Fargus acknowledges it could just be superstition, but still, since the everstorm went away, ships and crew have been disappearing with no trace...
he's heard of lucky people who have seen the boat, and managed to survive.
He's also heard of witches that roam the islands, consorting with dark demons from the Abyss. But he has never been to the islands himself, so he isn't sure.

We agree we should be ready for anything.
Fargus asks us about our experience at sea. Mostly we haven't been on more than a riverboat or coasthugger. Krattle-grak continues grousing about the chill (around 8Â°C today, a balmy day)
Yevan is unbothered, despite being shirtless. we banter about his nipples being hard enough to cut ice.

as we talk, Nilvar approaches. short brown hair, hazel eyes, not particularly buff, but looks like he can manage himself in a fight well. Lots of tattoos.
He's giving us a stern look: we should be working! And Fargus should be finishing the stew, and he was going to give Varrick a task - but since he prefers hearing stories and chatting instead of doing what he's supposed to do, perhaps he won't.

Last night, Fargus heard weird noises coming from the food stores. They believe something might've boarded the ship without permission. Since they're not a charity, they'd like it taken care of and booted off.

We get underway, under more needling from Nilvar. Fargus lets us know he's always like this; one gets used to it.
We get down into the cargo hold and start looking around.
Tabitha detects no magic.
Krattle-grak tries to track down the whatever-it-is. 
He finds some weird slimy masses of goo!

goo fight time :)
after the fight, Tabitha recalls that these are giant amoebas, and relays information on them to the party.
Krattle-grak binds Tabitha's mild acid burns.
Yevan grabs a bucket and scoops up some acid.

We head back upstairs and find Nilvar. He acknowledges our findings and dismisses us. We decide to go bother Fargus again, to see if lunch is ready. We arrive to a delicious smell, warm and inviting: clearly the stew is getting along well.
It's not done yet, though; Fargus is still chopping and stirring.

Tabitha offers Fargus a hand and tells him about the amoebas and the damaged barrels. He recalls buying something from a seller - a scammer, he now says - who claimed it could be used to make delicious jellies, and offered samples that supported this. Presumably this is how the giant amoebas got introduced, whoops!
Varrick does some experimenting to see if chalk (neutralizing the acid) can make this palatable, but it merely neutralizes the acid and still tastes terrible.

Around midafternoon, Yuu comes down from the crow's nest and approaches the captain. She see storm clouds on the horizon.

An hour or so later, rain starts falling, soon turning into a proper downpour. We lower the sail.

As we continue watching the ocean, we notice strange fog on the horizon, glowing faintly. It disappears as soon as we blink or look away. Tabitha goes to inform Nil of this; he says people sometimes see things on the seas, but to stay on guard.
As he does, a wave hits the ship, which rocks from the impact. Most of us get knocked off our feet, Varrick off his ass.
The fog is visible again, in the direction the wave came from. There's a ship there, rotted, with torn sails and barnacles and seaweed all over.
Captain Landra comes out of her room, cutlass in hand, shouting orders and questions.

We get ready for an attack of spooky ghosts: Tabitha scatters 5 copper coins, and Varrick sets up an arcane cascade.
The storm abates for a moment, except for a flash of lightning that briefly illuminates the ship and deposits two skeletons on the deck, full of sea debris, and two rotting, upright corpses, swollen with water.
There are more on other parts of the ship, engaging the other crew.
we fight!
coins: 1 shot into a zombie, 1 flung through a skeleton
Yevan gets knocked unconscious by the undead, picked up by a healing spell from Tabitha

Captain Landra is doing alright, the unnamed crewmates at the back are dead.

We hear a flash of thunder and a sound, the sea tilting sideways, and a giant wave crashes into the ship.

session ends! (rude)
