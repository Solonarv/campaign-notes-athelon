we start in Edelrogg, souther THelsya, valleys of Frostsomething mountains

early spring morning, ~8 am, frost in the grass and on windows

Alfsen Greyshaw, our employer, wants to meet us at a tavern, he'll arrive a few minutes after us. This was just a general call for adventurers, not addressed to us specifically.

people are having breakfast in the common room, cozy with warm fire

large 2story building, rock foundation and dark wood

innkeep shows us the table we're meant to meet at

Raevna was living here already, she's grumpy about something, picking at her porridge unenthusiastically

Minerva: old Ragari (cat) walks in, short (~1 m). looks to have been sweating, exhausted. she sits down at the closest table, pays no attention to her surroundings, pulls off traveling backpack as tall as she is. starts going through all the random crap in there, making a mess on the table, finally finds a little tea set and pouch which she brews up. Innkeeper's daughter approaches her timidly, asks if she wants to order some tea, but Minerva politely refuses while continuing to make a mess looking for her favorite tea-stewing cup. The innkeep asks her to order something, unless she has to, but her tablemate says "nono its ok, I don't mind sharing"

Moose turns out to have been sitting at that table already, orc (just over 6ft) young man, looks quite strong under his fur coat, but sitting with hunched shoulders trying to draw as little attention as possible. He offers to order something, to Minerva's "thanks dearie" (she then continues digging through her pile of random crap), and asks for another glass of water.

Minerva of Tall Grass has finally found the right teapot, and is heating it with *produce flame*. Meanwhile, Moose is trying his best not to stare, sitting on his hands.

Frax walks in just before the allotted time, stands there looking around awkwardly for the table he's meant to go to. He asks the innkeep for our employer, who replies that he hasn't arrived yet, but points out Raevna who's also waiting for Alfsen. They confirm that they're both meeting Alfsen.

Moose hears Alfsen's name and notices the two, but doesn't make a move just yet (too awkward). Minerva notices his awkwardness, though nothing else going on, and pours him some tea as well, while complaining about all the walking she's had to do this week.

This is when Alfsen Greyshaw - eighteen or nineteen, light brown hair, brown eyes, scruff of hair on his chin - walks in and visibly braces himself before approaching Raevna's table.

She greets him, and it takes him a moment to recognize her; he seems to be surprised she's here. Moose manages a very awkward introduction, complete with an un-needed letter of recommendation, and immediately sits down when prompted.

Frax Alfredson also introduces himself and just states he's here for the offer. Minerva also shoves herself in, having overheard the scheming, and offers her assistance in exchange for the expected cash. Alfsen denies any accusations of scheming, 

Alden (innkeeper name)

We all introduce ourselves:
- Raevna Kairi Asbjorn
- Moose Jaw
- Fraxinus
- Minerva of Tall Grass

Raevna gives her full name, and asks Alfsen to drop the 'Lady' - it's impolitic at the moment.

He starts explaining the situation:
- father died a few months ago, leaving all his worldly possessions and also debts.
- biggest debt was to the miners' guild
- they came, soon after the funeral, demanding money owed, which of course he is supposed to pay: the contracts hold.
- but he didn't have the money, at that time, so he asked for forbearance
	- as collateral, he had to give over the family's mines
- couldn't pay the debt, defaulted.
- he's not poor, don't you dare call him poor, he can totally pay us
- he's sure something's wrong, his father wouldn't leave him with all this debt, surely?
- he's not here to complain about his problems, but to ask help
- guild is trying to seize the mine, he says no I need more time, they're getting impatient
- they've been harassing his workers
	- many have stopped going to work, fearing the guild
- he needs us to find a way out of this contract, thinks there's something fishy about it.
- he acknowledges that he doesn't inspire much confidence, but assures us he can pay

Minerva asks what business his father did; none really, they're just nobles and owned different lands, though most were lost over the generations. Now there is only the mine and the estate left. If he loses the mine, his family will have nothing, and he can't do that to his siblings

Alfsen asks if we accept this job offer. Frax acquiesces

- Have those thugs leave my workers alone
	- it won't pay off my debt
	- if they have a problem, they should come to him, not his workers

Moose offers to help, apologizes for it, then apologizes for apologizing. Everyone chuckles, except for him.

Minerva asks for details of the contract. It's with the Miners' Guild of Edelrogg, who loaned his father a lot of money. He didn't know they'd needed this loan, but seeing the state of the family finances, it makes sense.

Alfsen claims his father's copy looks different from the version he remembers being signed

Raevna commends him for thinking of the workers, and says yeah, she'll help; can't be having the guilds pull stunts like this. Are the workers in the guild? no, the guild is mostly mine owners. She confirms that she's in, and so do the other three, against still-vague promises of payment.

Frax says he's glad we can help with Alfsen's trouble. Alfsen pulls out some papers: a map to the mines, so we don't get lost (they're an hour away), and his address in the city in case we need to speak to him.

Raevna suggests speaking to the miners first, to get a first-hand account of the harrassment.

Minerva warns Alfsen that she uses *animal messenger*, so if he hears a squirrel banging on his window, he'll know it's from her. He then excuses himself, covers Raevna's porridge, and leaves. Once he's outside, he drops his calm facade, and the near-panic he was feeling

Moose cautiously reaches for the map, and Raevna comments "oh, you're a tracker?", which he grudingly admits he can sorta kinda do. The rest of us acknowledge we'd do worse. The map isn't too detailed, but clearly well made. The innkeeper's daughter finally delivers his water, and he apologizes for changing tables.

The daughter asks if he's here for Alfsen's job; she sighs, says he's a good kid, and hopes he gets help with all his troubles.

Frax asks for anything at all for breakfast (it's his first time in a city), whatever the innkeep would recommend. He gets eggs and porridge; Raevna orders another helping of eggs.

Moose mumbles to himself about how he's glad he had breakfast before. He deflects Raevna's inquiries, but his stomach betrays his hunger, so she calls Valena (the innkeep's daughter) back and orders a bowl of eggs and porridge for him too.

Minerva brags about being the best do'Ragari chef, perhaps on the planet?

We discuss plans: breakfast, then off to the mine. Valena brings our orders and leaves.

Frax was thinking: should we find out when these thugs are attacking, and ambush them?
Find out what sort of harassment they've been suffering, what's been going on exactly.

We take off towards the mines, which are southeast of the city, in the mountains. The way there is a dirt path with visible wheelruts.

We find the mine without any trouble, taking about an hour to get there. It seems mostly empty; there are a few people around, but they're not going inside. Armed people are standing at the mine entrance, barring the way.

There are also some people - mostly men - sitting there, discussing something and looking at the thugs, complaining and stuff.

Minerva boldly approaches them and offers them the jerky she got from the inn. they refuse, confused.

Raevna follows, and says Alfsen Greyshaw hired us to help out.

Minerva complains about them refusing her food - rude! One of the other miners agrees, ribbing the guy who refused. He changes his tune, asking after Minerva's name, which she doesn't provide. She shoves the jerky at them and says to eat up, they're growing boys and this is hard work! (some of them are balding)

Minerva asks them for details of the harassment.
- no violence
- one day the thugs came, said they work for the miners guild
- some shoving, barring entrance
- they stopped the miners from working
- glad they don't have to work the mines, but they understand they can't exactly keep their jobs like this
	- this is the job they know, they have to sustain their families somehow and wouldn't know what else to do

any activity in the mine, or are they just occupying it?
- thugs haven't entered, as far as the miners know

Frax suggests nicely asking the thugs to leave them alone. Raevna asks the miners what they think of this idea: not much, as if they hadn't tried that before! says the grumpy one.

We discuss the possibility of chasing the thugs off by combat, but all agree this wouldn't help much; they'd just come back stronger.

Frax and Minerva suggest speaking to the thugs. Frax walks up to them and asks, "hello, what are you blocking this mine for?"

One thug replies, "what do you care for"

Frax: we're just intrigued, what's happening here?

thug: nothing's happening

frax: then y u here

thug: that's what we're here for

thug: we're here to prevent those guys from entering the mines

thug: idc why, I'm getting paid good money and it's easy work just standing here

frax: who's paying you?

thug: too many questions, my turn. what are you doing here?

Raevna: we were sent by the owner of this mine to see wtf is happening here

thug: we were also hired by the owner. are you talking about the previous owner:

Raevna: we were hired by Alfsen Greyshaw

Moose: but if he owes money, why are you blocking the mine, he can't make any money to pay you with

thug: look kid, we don't care. guild says lock up the mine, we lock up the mine.

Moose continues to be innocently confused by the evils of capitalism

Thug: if he's in debt, he'll probably pay with the mine. ever heard of collaterals?

Moose: erm... no?

Minerva: so you admit to the extortion?

Thug: look, grandma, idc how the guild does things, but a collateral is not extortion.

Frax: you know, a minute ago you had no idea why you're here, but now you're quite the expert!

thug: look, if you want to do anything about it, you jsut can't go into the mine. if not, jsut leave, we're not being paid to talk to you

frax: you're not being paid to do much at all

thug: true! and that's how we like it

minerva: a conversation with you wouldn't be worth paying for!

minerva: im an old lady, walked for two, three weeks, my feet hurt. could you just get out of the way? it'd be so much easier!

she rolls a nat 20 persuasion (at +0)

the thug mocks her.

Just as we leave, Raevna whirls around dramatically and asks if perhaps someone's been sneaking in here to do a bit of mining.

Raevna: I'm sure all this talking has been mighty exhausting, you can go back to doing nothing now.

We leave the thugs alone, and discuss whether to resort to violence.

Raevna talks to the miners again, and says we were discussing violence. The miners are initially in favor of beating them up, but Raevna explains they'd just come back tomorrow, in greater numbers. 

She asks them to stay here a little longer, and watch the thugs to let her know if they (for example) report this encounter to anyone, giving them 1 gp up front and telling them to leave a message for Raevna Kairi Asbjorn at the Lazy Giant Inn if they do. She promises another 1 gp later, if they don't flake.

We return to the city...

Minerva brews tea while walking, which baffles and impresses the others. She makes a big deal of it: new friends, new greeting, Ragari tradition. The tea is disgusting, a fact which Moose  manages to hide, but Raevna doesn't.

Raevna asks if this tea tastes differently to Ragari; Minerva explains that it does, actually, it's like the nectar of the gods to them. Raevna regrets that she can't properly appreciate it; Minerva says it's either that, or just an acquired taste.

She takes the cup Frax declined, and chugs it in one gulp.

Raevna explains that she can simply go and request an audience with the local guildmaster, using her position and signet ring.

She cautions the others not to count on any miracles when it comes to sweet-talking the guildmaster; all she can do is get us in.

We make it back to the city without getting lost, and end here so Maxx can figure out the meeting with the guildmaster.
