as we resume, the sun is close to setting and we still dont know what happened to Lydia.

Tarot informs us of what he looted; the smokestick (which he hands to Tabitha) and the silversheen. He also suggests Anthil would make the best use of the silversheen.

We debate whether to continue following the trail, as the sun is already setting (it's around 20). We got up around 8 or so.

Anthil suggests saying a few words for the dead, and does so: "May the door close behind you, and not in front." We spend a short while in contemplation but move on quickly so as not to lose daylight.

Anthil manages to pick the trail back up and leads us along it, along the riverbank. The drag marks are more visible in the mud there. Eventually, the trail converges with another trail of drag marks, and then two more join in. This all leads to a dark cavern opening.

A small stream of water is coming out of the cavern and into the river.

Tarot lights his lantern using some oil from his belt pouch, so we can see into the cavern. We approach the entrance. There is a smell of blood, and putrefaction - the smell of death, very nasty.

Anthil figures animal predators tend to like caves, as they are very defensible and make for good shelter. However, the stream of water indicates this isn't just some small hole in the earth, and with the smell, he does not think an actual animal would be here - it would not want to be surrounded by the stinky rotting things. He shares this information.

Tarot looks around trying to spot any clues as to what sort of creature this might be.

Aldon wants to rush in. Tabitha stops him and checks with *detect magic*; there is indeed something in the cave.

Tarot asks Tabitha about the scrolls she mentioned, and she gives him a *scroll of magic weapon*. He claims this is equal exchange for the smokestick, but Tabitha is dubious.

We enter the cave. the water is cold, unsurprisingly, and the scent of blood is getting stronger. echoes of unintelligible grumbling. markings on the cavern walls: painted in now-old blood.

Tabitha comments: "this cave's a lot wetter than it looked from the outside"

the shapes of the markings seem like symbols: three moons on a line, and above them, an eye.

We all try to remember wtf this symbol is.
Tarot & Tabitha: the moons suggest this might be related to one of the three moon deities worshipped in Athelon, but we don't know if this is an actual religious symbol.
Aldon and Anthil: this doesn't look anything like a religious symbol they've seen before. It clearly has some adjacent purpose from the way it's used here, but doesn't belong to any god worshipped in modern Athelon.

Tarot takes this as further evidence for werewolves.

Tabitha casts *read aura* on the wall markings: not magical. She reports this.

We continue on, the grumbling getting louder. Eventually we see two creatures, small bulbous bipeds. They're eating something.

We approach, and the light from Tarot's lantern alerts them to our presence. Anthil and Tabitha try to sneak up on them.

They have sharp needle-like teeth dripping blood, and beneath them is a corpse whose gray skin indicates it was once a half-orc. They attack us!
 - dretch 1 runs up to Aldon and tries to bite him, bouncing off his shield.
 - we all feel a voice inside our heads: screams and growls. Tarot understands that this is Abyssal: "we are busy. we were eating. why fight? we kill you"
 - dretch 2 runs closer and hunkers down protectively.
 - Tarot moves into melee, and rememberes basically everything about dretches in a flash of insight. Dretches are a very lowly demon, made from the souls of people partook in the sin of sloth. Usually they just end up following orders. They're weak to cold iron (3) and good (3). He sprinkles a tiny amount of holy water on his blade and embeds his pick deep in the dretch (fat crit). The dretch growls at 
 - Tabitha evokes some rocks at the dretches and raises a magical shield.
 - Anthil repositions and barely clips dretch 1 with a throw of one of his forks.
 - Aldon raises his shield, draws his whip, and trips dretch 1.
 - dretch 1 flails at Tarot ineffectively. it looks lethargic.
 - dretch 2 moves into melee, fails to bite Tarot, and curls up again.
 - Tarot demolishes dretch 1. "pathetic." He hooks his pick under its head and pulls up. He focuses on the other dretch and tries to trip it unsuccessfully.
 - Tabitha bashes dretch 2 with some more rocks.
 - Anthil marks dretch 2 and tosses his second fork in its general direction. He grabs a backup fork.
 - Aldon glares at dretch 2, it is unimpressed. He fails to trip it and raises his shield.
 - The dretch attacks Tarot and refuses Aldon's offer of redemption. Tarot starts bleeding. It curls up into a ball again.
 - Tarot moves to flank the dretch, intimidates it with (he speaks abyssal!), and then brings down his pick, but misses.
 - Tabitha repeats her previous procedure: scatter scree, shield.
 - Anthil grabs another fork, walks up to the dretch, and gets to stabbin' (not very effectively, because it is too curled-up).
 - Aldon keeps his shield up, trips the dretch, and does not connect with a whip strike.
 - the dretch tries to stand up, and dodges Tarot's pick. He bites Tarot, knocking him out. Then it balls up again.
 - Tabitha repeats her *scatter scree* - *shield* standby.
 - Anthil patches up Tarot's hemorrhaging wound
 - Aldon picks Tarot up with *lay on hands*
 - Tarot stands up, picks up his weapon, and brings his weapon down... missing the dretch.
 - The dretch slashes at Anthil in a frenzy (3 attacks). Only the first one hits, and is mollified by Aldon's glimpse of redemption. The attack cuts through Anthil's shirt, exposing his nasty chest wounds.
 - Tabitha evokes more rocks, and walks into melee finally.
 - Anthil picks up one of his dropped forks, and attempts to lay into the dretch. He finally finishes it off with a critical hit, sticking his fork in its face and ripping upward.

The combat over, we take stock. We proceed cautiously, Aldon praying to Celyria as he goes. Even though the cave is dark and dreadful, he feels the calming touch of Celyria through the waters.

We can now see the corpse the dretches were eating more clearly. It was a middle-aged half-orc woman, her guts spilled out as the dretches were eating it. Bloody sigils are carved into her skin, all over her body. Anthil speaks the same short prayer over her.

We decide to head back out of the cave and take 20 minutes to refocus and heal up some. As we head to the exit, we hear an old man's voice echoing from behind us (inside the cave), saying "So someone got inside and they killed two of the dretches. Doesn't matter. The enlightened one doesn't suffer from this."

As we rest, Tarot recites the information he remembered about dretches. He supposes that they may also represent gluttony, due to how often they are seen eating corpses with no regard for their own health.

We banter a bit about the probability we estimate of Lydia still being alive.

Tabitha looks at sigils on the half-orc's body: seems to be some sort of ritual-sacrifice carvings. they seem to have been carved while still alive. *Read aura* pings it as not magical. She reports this to the party, visibly discomforted by the gore.
Aldon tries to comfort her, and she assures him she can handle it; she hasn't seen gore this bad before, but dealing with it is worth the information. Anthil sympathizes.

We trudge onward to the water. Pressing on, we hear sounds of prayer, or something like it - the cultist chanting kind. Tarot understands some of this: "oh enlightened one, may you take this sacrifice and bring your gaze upon this world." He informs us they seem to be tryng to summon something. "We are but mere ants to you. May you deliver us when you rise again, oh enlightened one."
We advance carefully, and Aldon rounds a corner. He's notices by an old man with long unkempt hair, balding at the top. He switches his prayer to Common. "Oh enlightened one, forgive us for letting these intruders into here. THey shall know your retribution, from us or when you rise again. If we die here, our blood is yours."
Aldon politely inquires about Lydia, and the old man answers with a creepy yes. Tabitha exhorts him to take this as sufficient evidence of wrongdoing and we surge forward, into combat.
Aldon and Tarot see an altar, upon which is a naked body with markings carved into the skin. The person has long red hair.
 - Tabitha rushes forward and sprays a dazzling array of colors at the cultists and their dretch minion. The old man takes the full force, the dretch is just a bit dazzled, and the old woman cultist is unaffected.
 - Aldon strides in front of Tabitha, raises his shield, and trips the old man.
 - The old woman says "she's now part of a higher purpose! her blood is now his... her soul is now his...", and throws a dagger at Aldon. He mostly blocks it with his shield. She moves around the old man and dretch, then stabs Aldon.
 - Anthil jumps in and gets to stabbing the old man.
 - the dretch slashes at Anthil with its claws
 - the old man just runs
 - Tarot uses his *scroll of magic weapon* and finds a personal antithesis for ??
 - Tabitha evokes some rocks and gets off the bridge.
 - We can now see more corpses, and those that haven't been eaten seem to have had their hearts carved out.
 - Aldon uses his whip to throw the dretch on its ass, keeps his shield up, and demoralizes the old woman by threat of Tarot-pickaxe.
 - The old woman throws more daggers at Aldon
 - Anthil misses the dretch with his forks, and legs it
 - the dretch gets up, moves, and attacks Aldon
 - the old man gets into a state of mania, runs up to Aldon, and throws a dagger at Tabitha (who dodges).
 - Tarot gets behind the dretch, and begins mining it.
 - Tabitha evokes more rocks and raises a magical shield.
 - Aldron trips the the old man
 - The old woman throws her last dagger at Tabitha, who dodges. Aldon once again offers her redemption. She replies: "Even if we stop, the enlightened one will come. Do what you want with us."
 - Anthil does another hit-and-run maneuver, stabbing the dretch dead.
 - the old man stands up, and ineffectively tries to stab Aldon twice.
 - Tarot strides in, and smashes his pick into the old man.
 - Tabitha throws more rocks around and keeps her magical shield raised
 - Aldon steps forward, keeps his shield up, and fails to trip the old woman.
 - the old woman walks over to the altar, but gets Tarot's pick to the back of the head as she turns away from him.

We inspect the body on top of the altar. It fits the description of Lydia that we got. Her skin is covered in sigils and her heart has been carved out.
We improvise a way to carry Lydia's corpse from wood scraps around here.
Tarot inspects the altar. There is an opening in the cave ceiling above the altar, letting the night sky show through.
Both cultists have the three-moons-and-eye symbol scarified over their hearts. The moons are crossed out with a line.
