no preconceived notions of a big overarching plot

"if you guys want to travel to the moon i will see if you can do that"

char creation:
- available species are in world doc
- species version: latest non-'24e appearance, flexible racial ASIs
- extra starting feat 

topic NOs:
- sexual harrassment/abuse (not "on camera", does exist in the setting though)
- not crazy about bugs (squeamish) - no details
- vomiting &cetera (squeamish) - no details
	- also other bodily fluids (except blood, see below)
- no ultragore

leveling by "the DM decides" milestone

if we try going to the moon things may get worse back on Athelon while we're gone

we will not be evil but probably not goody-two-shoes either

character driven campaign, how do our characters interact

campaign hook changed a bit maybe: help our employer with somethingsomething.
